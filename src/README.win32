The Makefile in this directory is intended to build the Tcl tkema extension
on either Solaris or Windows.

Solaris:

	gmake clean
	gmake

Windows
	make clean
	make

The windows environment "supported" is Mingw, not cygnus.

Building with Microsoft Visual C was previously done in the cygnus
environment with the 'setup' and 'Makefile.win32' files.  It could
probably be updated to work with current VC & Tcl versions fairly
easily, but has not been.
