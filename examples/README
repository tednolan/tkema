Here are some sample TkEMA scripts.
They all contain the line:

	lappend auto_path ./lib

which you will have to adjust to specify where you have placed the TkEMA
shared library if you install them elsewhere.

Remember, specify models without the .nt.m or pr.m suffixes.

doit -
	Build a network from an SDF and predefined platforms.
	Seems to be fragmentary 

net_build -
	Seems to be another build a net from SDF program.  Wish
	I remembered..

ped -
	GUI based editor for Opnet process models

print_plat -
	Given a network name and the name of a mobile subnet, print all
	the attribute information for the subnet

proc_dump -
	Given a process model name, extract the C code from the model
	into a directory with the same name as the model

proc_load -
	Undo a proc_load, take the C code in a diectory with the same name
	as a model, and stuff it back in the model.

pview  -
	Display a process model on screen.  Allow saving or printing an
	encapsulated PostScript representation of the model
